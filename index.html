          <p>I'm Danielle Torres, a Software Engineer who enjoys coding new applications using JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React.js, and Redux.
            I love using my analytic skills to troubleshoot issues and to find solutions whether its using web development tools or SQL. Some of my skills 
            comes from my love for Genealogy that requires a lot of detail analysis and investigation work to put the pieces of the past together. My love for frontend development
            comes from artistic side that loves to paint and draw.<br><br>
            
            I have 10 years experience in the tech field as a Senior Application Analyst and have trained clients all over the 
            states in Data Dictionary and Data Model Diagram. I have built wonderful customer relationships through excellant customer support. I enjoy getting on a client call and 
            analyzing their need and documenting the requirements so I can begin the process of developing a solution.
